# Manticore Defense
## What is it?
A game! Manticore Defense is a console-based guessing game. The Manticore is a ship attacking a city, and you've been asked to direct that city's defenses. To do so, you need to tell the defenses how far to shoot by guessing how far away the Manticore is from the city. It's a round-based game where the Manticore's location is randomized at the start of each game.

## Why did I make it?
